# CASCADE - CONTACTLESS CAFETARIA ORDERING SYSTEM


## Introduction

The software product is named Cafeteria Ordering System. Keeping track of the cafeteria menu, attendance, and consumption is a difficult task. Manual and paper-based procedures are cumbersome and prone to errors, resulting in inaccuracy and waste of time and resources. Therefore, an automated canteen management system is essential. </br>
This project attempts to build a canteen management system that analyzes food consumption and waste by item, offers customers a convenient website ordering system, and includes an AI-based attendance system. Meals for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, as well as special days and events, may all be planned. This project enables menu item monitoring, quick transactions, and the avoidance of accounting errors. Customers can also provide feedback using the feedback function, which allows the canteen manager to analyze and make necessary adjustments to the system.

## Features

The Cafeteria Ordering System assists the canteen manager in managing the canteen more efficiently and effectively by automating meal ordering, billing, and inventory control. The AI-based attendance and food collection tracking can help to ensure effective food distribution, as well as penalty and refund decisions. 
The system analyses transactions and saves the generated data, which the manager may use to produce reports and make informed business choices for the canteen. The management, for example, can determine whether extra canteen staff is necessary based on the number of customers for a specific time frame. In addition, one can easily calculate daily expenses and profits. The system will evolve over several releases, eventually connecting to the college's online ordering system and credit and debit card authorization services.
